By this I mean an ISA, assembler, emulator, BIOS/ROM, and OS.</p><p>The assembler is based upon the architecture found in <a href="../hyperlisp" target="_blank">HyperLisp</a>, with additional features like <code>.include</code> statements which I may or may not backport to HyperLisp.</p><p>The OS is currently the begginings of a kernel, booted by the ROM from a very simple filesystem, with a rudimentary memory allocator and some code to interact with said filesystem. Ideally it will be fully preemptive, however with no memory protection and paging for the simplicity of the architecture, much like AmigaOS.</p><p>It is not really a pretty or user-friendly project, but you can check it out on its <a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/some-pc" target="blank">GitHub repository</a> if you wish to. You must first compile and install some-as, then some-emu, then rom, and finally someos, however I have not made a proper utility for creating the disk image, which you will have to do yourself based on the code and "documentation". Good luck!</p></body></html>
