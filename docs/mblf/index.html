It's assembly-close-enough and has 14 instructions for common tasks in Brainfuck programs. It uses a unique "pointing" system, where instructions act upon the currently pointed variable and an additional variable or value provided in an argument, allowing you to chain actions like so:</p><pre>var a ;; create variable 'a'

point a ;; start acting upon the variable 'a'
getchr ;; take one character from the user
print ;; print the same character
sub 1 ;; print the previous character in the alphabet/ascii
print</pre><p>Its original compiler did things pretty badly and was written in JavaScript, it had a few extra instructions like <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, but I unfortunately removed it.</p><p>My friend <a href="https://raymon.dev/" target="_blank">Raymon</a> wrote a new version of the compiler in Rust using Pest grammar. You can find it on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mblf" target="_blank">crates.io</a>.</p><p>I have created a <a href="reference.txt" target="_blank">very rough cheat sheet for the language</a>. If you have any problems, feel free to contact me.</p></body></html>
