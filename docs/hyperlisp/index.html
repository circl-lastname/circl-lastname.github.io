My friend <a href="https://raymon.dev/" target="_blank">Raymon</a> had previously expressed a want for making websites using Lisp syntax, and so on the base of this parser I created HyperLisp!</p><p>HyperLisp!â„¢ is a preprocessor provides a 1:1 mapping of HTML to Lisp syntax, in fact I am using it right now to write this page.</p><p>You can find the source as well as a quick guide on the <a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/HyperLisp" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>. If you don't want to bother compiling it, you can try out the <a href="/HyperLisp-demo" target="_blank">online demo</a> powered by <a href="https://emscripten.org/" target="_blank">Emscripten</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/HyperLisp" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-HyperLisp!-blue"></a></p></body></html>
