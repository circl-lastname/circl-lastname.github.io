I forked an <a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/6502js" target="_blank">online 6502 simulator</a>, and I enjoyed messing around with it.</p><p>I use <a href="http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/" target="_blank">vasm</a> as my assembler, and a <a href="dcbify.js" target="_blank">node script</a> I made to convert the binary data to <code>dcb</code> statements for the online simulator.</p><p>Writing a basic command line interface and a simple paint app using the built-in screen has introduced me to low-level assembly coding, and ultimately helped me understand C and lower-level programming in general.</p></body></html>
