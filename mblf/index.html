    <h1>MBLF and Brainfuck stuff</h1>
    
    <p>In order to simplify Brainfuck development, I made a language called MBLF. It's assembly-close-enough and has 14 instructions for common tasks in Brainfuck programs. It uses a unique "pointing" system, where instructions act upon the currently pointed variable and an additional variable or value provided in an argument, allowing you to chain actions like so:</p>
    <p>
      <code>
      var a ;; create variable 'a'<br>
      <br>
      point a ;; start acting upon the variable 'a'<br>
      getchr ;; take one character from the user<br>
      print ;; print the same character<br>
      sub 1 ;; print the previous character in the alphabet/ascii<br>
      print
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>Its original compiler did things pretty badly and was written in JavaScript, it had a few extra instructions like <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, but I unfortunately removed it.</p>
    <p>My friend <a href="https://raymon.dev/" target="_blank">Raymon</a> wrote a new version of the compiler in Rust using Pest grammar. You can find it on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mblf" target="_blank">crates.io</a>.</p>
    <p>I have created a <a href="reference.txt" target="_blank">very rough cheat sheet for the language</a>. If you have any problems, feel free to contact me.</p>
