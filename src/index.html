<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I'm circl (they/them), I develop some open-source software as a hobby, and am currently studying as an IT technician. I'm Polish and speak Polish and English.</p>
<p>I take interest in systems programing and backends (C and JS), though most of my "completed" projects are small web apps. Those are the only ones I keep open-source as I tend to remove projects which I lose interest in or have never finished.</p>
<p>My most significant open-source contributions are to the <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird" target="_blank">Ladybird</a> web browser.</p>
