<h1>LPE</h1>
<p>Local Palette Encoding (LPE) is a lossy image compression format that provides a compression ratio of 6.4:1 in most cases and acceptable image quality using only simple integer math. Its method of operation is quite simple, the image is split into 8x8 blocks and a palette of 2 values is picked for each channel, the image is then dithered using those local palettes.</p>
<p>I have written a portable encoding/decoding library (<a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/lpe/tree/main/liblpe" target="_blank">liblpe</a>) as well as some simple utilities (<a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/lpe/tree/main/lpe-utils" target="_blank">lpe-utils</a>) which can create and convert LPE files.</p>
<p>Here are two images encoded in LPE:</p>
<p><img src="lenna.lpe"></p>
<p><img src="tatra.lpe"></p>
<p>Here's a cool thing, these images have been decoded locally by your browser, thanks to liblpe compiled to WASM and a bit of a hacky script to achieve this: <a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/lpe/tree/main/lpe-web" target="_blank">lpe-web</a></p>
