<h1>Hyperlisp!</h1>
<p>I made a simple Lisp lexer/parser in C as a coding exercise, and decided to create HyperLisp! using it.</p>
<p>HyperLisp!â„¢ is a preprocessor that provides a 1:1 mapping of HTML to Lisp syntax. You can find the source as well as a quick guide on the <a href="https://github.com/circl-lastname/HyperLisp" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>. If you don't want to bother compiling it, you can try out the <a href="https://circl-lastname.github.io/HyperLisp-demo" target="_blank">online demo</a> powered by <a href="https://emscripten.org/" target="_blank">Emscripten</a>.</p>
